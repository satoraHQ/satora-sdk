# @lendasat/lendaswap-sdk-pure

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 43a6fc7: Add `getBulkStatus(ids)` to fetch the status of many swaps in a single request.

  Returns `{ statuses, not_found }` — only each swap's status, so the whole batch is served by one database query. Unknown IDs are returned in `not_found` instead of throwing, so one bad ID does not fail the whole call. Backed by the new `POST /swap/bulk-status` endpoint (max 100 IDs per request).

- 9f4d595: Add support for EURe in Arbitrum.
  SDK uses new orchestration flow.

### Patch Changes

- 0fb68c7: Export the real SDK version from the package entry point. `SDK_VERSION`, `SDK_NAME`, and `CLIENT_AGENT` are now re-exported from the index (sourced from the generated `version.ts`); the stale hard-coded `VERSION = "0.0.1"` export is removed.
- ed3d6d8: Export `SDK_COMMIT_HASH` — the git commit the SDK was built from. It's injected into the generated `version.ts` at build time from the `GIT_COMMIT_HASH` env var (set in CI on publish, same convention as the backend), and defaults to `"unknown"` for local builds. Lets consumers report the exact SDK source revision (e.g. in a version footer).
